# Generate a prompt to extract essential information from each article

Act as senior data scientists and engineer. You need to build "a system that answers user questions by querying both a structured database (SQL) and an unstructured text corpus (via vector search), the solution should not use advanced LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain, LlamaIndex) It should leverage low level SDKs like the OpenAI library directly,". There is a list of research papers available for this task. You need to review and understand the research papers and extract information and implementation details that is relevant for the system to build. Focus on more practical information such as design, architecture, libraries, data processing techniques, data preparation techniques, etc. Generate a prompt that can be applied iteratively over each one the list of research papers and return result not bigger than 500 words. Save the generated prompt as md file.
