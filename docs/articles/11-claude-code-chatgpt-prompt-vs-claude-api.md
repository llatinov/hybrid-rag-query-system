## Alternative Analysis Approach

Based on the URL structure (`S2666827025000246`), I can provide guidance on how to analyze this article:

### Recommended Steps:

1. **Access Through Institutional Login**
   - If you have university/institutional access, log in through your library portal
   - Many institutions have ScienceDirect subscriptions

2. **Use Alternative Sources**
   - Check if a preprint exists on arXiv, ResearchGate, or author's personal page
   - Look for the DOI on Google Scholar for alternative access points

3. **Request the Full Text**
   - Use the "Request full text" feature on ResearchGate
   - Contact the authors directly via email

4. **Share Key Information**
   If you can access the article, please provide:
   - Article title
   - Authors
   - Abstract
   - Publication date
   - Key sections or figures

## Regarding Hybrid RAG Query Systems

Once you have access, I can help analyze how the article relates to hybrid RAG systems by examining:
- Information retrieval methodologies
- Query processing techniques
- Knowledge integration approaches
- Vector/semantic search combinations
- Retrieval augmentation strategies

**Would you be able to share the article title, abstract, or PDF so I can provide the detailed analysis you need?**
