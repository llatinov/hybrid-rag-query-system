# Design RAG system without using Vector database

I want to design a RAG system without vector database. There is many articles and users can ask questions on those articles. I need to process the articles and create embeddings out of it. Then incoming search string will be embedded also and used to search. Questions: 1. How to create the embeddings? 2. What is the optimal size to chunk the article? 3. Do we store all the embeddings into one big dataset along with the text or split by articles? 4. Provide example code.
